                                <h3>Traits</h3>
                                <p class="copy my-3">
                                    Traits, alongside a character’s Stats and Equipment are the defining characteristic that makes a character who and what they are. The Trait system is flexible and functions as a catchall category of things a character knows, things a character can do, things a character belongs to, and relationships the character may have with others. Traits are named and self-contained characteristics categorized by what the Trait is and how it interacts with characters and the game’s systems. A Trait will typically either be part of a structured category that defines how the Trait is used, or it will contain a description that describes how the Trait manifests itself.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Traits are almost always additive, conveying some additional capability or capacity that a character has, though a rare few can convey negative attributes or restrictions. Trait effects are wide-ranging, from bonuses to certain skill checks to combat buffs to new abilities. They can describe a character's relationships to a society, such as memberships in exclusive organizations or even a wanted status for a criminal on the run. Traits can be temporary conditions, such as describing the ramifications of a character's broken leg. Because Traits are so varied, they will typically be organized on a character’s sheet by their theme or by how they are used.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Characters start with a series of Traits based on their background packages. A character’s Species, Origin, Profession, and Past all grant a starting package of Traits that will help to inform who and what a character is. From there a character gains additional feats through accruing experience and leveling up or through in-game circumstances.
                                    <br><br>
                                    There are three primary ways permanent Traits are gained:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        They are granted by a background package when the character is created.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        They are granted automatically every time a character levels up.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        They are gained through in-game actions or occurrences.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p class="my-3">Temporary Traits can be granted through equipment or can be based on temporary circumstances, such as an injury sustained or short-term fame gained from a notorious act. Temporary Traits should have the time or circumstance of their ending in their description.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Traits are self-contained pieces of information assigned to a character or object with specific requirements and effects.</li>
                                    <li>Traits will typically list their name, category, type, and effect in a single place of reference. Traits can be listed by their name on character sheets and in descriptions, with the Traits effects referenced only when needed.</li>
                                    <li>Universal Traits or background Traits are given at every level, alternating between Universal (odd-numbered levels) or background (even-numbered levels).</li>
                                    <li>If, when a character levels, they do not wish to gain a new Trait they can "bank" that Trait, until an in-game RP circumstance presents them with the opportunity to gain a Trait that they want. This is a good way for a player to gain Conveyed Traits without it feeling forced.</li>
                                    <li>Backgrounds can give additional Traits, and typically provide several when adopted that provide a baseline of Traits that inform a character's background and circumstances.</li>
                                    <li>Traits can have an outer ring skill level requirement.</li>
                                    <li>Traits can be gained outside of leveling and can be lost.</li>
                                    <li>Traits can be temporary.</li>
                                    <li>Traits always have a category, like Knowledge or Condition, that determines how the Trait is used in the game.</li>
                                    <li>Traits can have a type like (Supernatural), (Injury), or (Cybernetic). These will typically be used in concert with in-game effects that target specific types of Traits, such as a doctor healing Injury Traits. These types have no effect on their own.</li>
                                    <li>Traits that would require training can only be gained if the character has received training relevant to that Trait or has been performing a related action for long enough. This is at DM discretion.</li>
                                    <li>Some Traits will require a character to already possess a prerequisite Trait in order to be gained (Such as a Pilot Trait being a prerequisite for the Expert Pilot Trait).</li>
                                    <li>Some Traits have specific, listed, role playing requirements.</li>
                                    <li>Unless it is a Ranked Trait then a Traits effect does not stack. Multiple instances of the same Trait will only have the effect of a single instance of that Trait.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3>Trait Ranks</h3>
                                <p class="my-3">
                                    Some Traits, such as all Knowledges, can be Ranked up. These are different from Traits with successive requirements, such as Marksman being a requisite for Master Marksman. Ranked Traits do not change when Ranked Up, but provide a multiple to their bonuses equal to their rank level. As an example, Pilot: Small Boat(3) has been ranked up 3 times and provides a Roll Modifier to a piloting skill check of +30, representing the Traits bonus of 10 multiplied by the three times it has been ranked up.
                                    <br><br>
                                    A Trait can only be Ranked up beyond Rank (1) if the character has each required Stat for that Trait greater than or equal to 3 times the new Rank level. As an example, a character wishing to Rank Pilot: Small Boat to Rank 3 would need at least a Grace and Memory stats of 9.
                                </p>

                                <hr class="my-5">

                                <h3>Universal And background Traits</h3>
                                <p class="mb-3">
                                    When a character is selecting Traits while leveling up they will pick either Universal or background Traits depending on their level. Unless a Trait is specified as background, then it is assumed to be Universal. background Traits are typically skills, areas of knowledge, or abilities that are related to a character’s Past or identity. A character selects background Traits from a list generated by their background package. Some background Traits will have RP requirements; these will be listed in that Traits requirements. As an example, a human can't just grow longer teeth, but an aged Orcs fangs can continue to grow as their power or prestige advances, conferring social benefits to them. This would be represented by the Longfanged Trait, and in its description it will describe bonuses to social situations between Orcs.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Many Traits in the list generated by a character's background package are Universal Traits that are thematically related to that background package. These give a character an opportunity to take or advance these Traits rapidly, especially if they are Ranked Traits. A character with a Profession of pilot will be able to take or Rank up pilot-related Traits at double the speed of a character that does not have those Traits in their background list.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Starter-only Traits</h3>
                                <p class="mb-3">
                                    These are background Traits that can only be taken during character creation, representing some unique skill, nest egg, or heirloom the character possesses that they gained at some point during their lives. Many starter Traits will have specific requirements, such as the Pirate Scion Profession being required for the Starter Trait Inherited ship.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Conveyed Traits</h3>
                                <p class="mb-3">
                                    These are Traits that can not be taken when a character levels up unless the DM allows it. These will often represent tangible improvements to a character that would be difficult to justify without a relevant roleplaying rationale. As an example, the Eagle Eye Trait implies a tangible and significant improvement to a character's long-distance vision. This could come about as a result of mystical training, mutation, a latent ability of a Species or Origin, or some other rationale. Conveyed Traits will often not have a minimum stat requirement.
                                </p>

                                <hr class="my-5">
                                <h3 class="mb-3">Trait Categories</h3>
                                <p class="copy">
                                    Because Traits can take so many different forms, they are subdivided into seven categories. The categories listed below represent the fundamental basic categories of a Trait. The Traits category determines how it interacts with characters and the game's systems.
                                    <h5 class="mt-4">Knowledges</h4>
                                    <p>Knowledges are Traits that are gained exclusively either by in-game RP effort or are conferred by background packages. Multiple backgrounds can confer the same knowledge Trait, but unless otherwise specified, this does not increase the knowledge's rank. Knowledge can be learned multiple times, but each rank increase involves a commensurate level of increased time, difficulty, or financial investment. Knowledges and additional knowledge ranks can also be conferred by items, magic, or cybernetics or can be gained temporarily via research, but there are limitations to how these forms of knowledge can be utilized.<br><br>
                                    When creating a new character, a player can choose to use universal or background traits that they would gain due to their level to gain knowledge Traits instead. This is to represent additional areas of knowledge the character would have accrued up to that point in their lives but that may not be specifically written out in the character's background packages (such as the character getting a bachelor's in history, allowing them to gain History (2) as a starting character from the Terran Demarchy). It is up to the DM to decide how high a knowledge rank can be gained in this way.<br><br>
                                    Outside of character creation, knowledge can only be gained via in-game RP occurrences, such as a character spending a semester learning fencing or a character having the layout of a forest magically conveyed to them. It is DM discretion to determine how easy or difficult knowledges are to attain and where their limitations are.</p>
                                    <h5 class="mt-4">Languages</h4>
                                    Languages confer the ability for the learner to speak or read/write in that language. Language traits represent a character's ability to communicate using that language. Most languages will be granted by a character's background package, but languages can also be temporarily granted by ex machina devices like universal translators or magic amulets. Languages can also be learned in the same fashion as knowledge Traits. Languages function as both knowledge and an ability in that they describe a character's ability to understand and use a language. A language Trait will typically describe how the character can use that language, such as English (Spoken).</p>
                                    <h5 class="mt-4">Skills</h4>
                                    <p>Skill traits represent a character's ability to perform a specific task or engage in a specific activity without fumbling or failing to even understand the basics. A skill is like knowledge in that it is a learned Trait, but unlike knowledge, skill Traits can be gained over time through training and effort, even without outside aid. Many skills are ranked Traits and represent the additive bonuses conveyed through practice and mastery in a given task. Other skill Traits represent additional improvements or aspects of mastery that go beyond a simple bonus to a die roll during a skill check. Mastery skill Traits will typically list prerequisite traits that a character must already possess before they can take the more advanced Trait. Skill Traits can be selected when a character is choosing level-up skills, but it is recommended that the DM only allow them to select skill Traits they had been learning or utilizing.</p>
                                    <h5 class="mt-4">Abilities</h4>
                                    <p>Abilities are Traits that confer some sort of ability to a character. This can come in a wide variety of forms, from a character's ability to fly being granted by Natural Flight to a character's ability to Hide in Plain Sight conferring their ability to sneak and go undetected even while being observed. Abilities are the most common kind of trait to be conferred by items or equipment, as they represent some sort of specific physical or mental feat that a character can perform. Not all abilities are physical, but most manifest as something other than modifying a skill check. Often abilities are Innate to a Species or culture and will be automatically conferred to them by their Species or Origin packages. An ability Trait will always describe what it does and when it can be used, though it will be at DM discretion to determine the boundaries of when an ability can be applicable to a situation.</p>
                                    <h5 class="mt-4">Circumstance</h4>
                                    <p>Circumstance Traits describe a character's relationship with the world around them and will typically list noteworthy or exceptional characteristics. While virtually any description of a character's place in society could be listed as a Trait this should be reserved for important or unique aspects of a character. As an example, membership in a thieves guild would be listed as a Circumstance Trait, but membership at Costco would not. Circumstance Traits are almost exclusively Conveyed Traits given by a character's background or are granted by RP occurrences and can rarely be taken as level-up Traits. Just as Circumstance Traits can be gained in RP scenarios, they can also be lost in the same way, with the aforementioned thief being ejected from the Guild after double-crossing another member. Circumstance Traits will typically not have a minimum stat requirement.</p>
                                    <h5 class="mt-4">Conditions</h4>
                                    <p>Condition Traits are Traits that represent some sort of ongoing status. These will typically describe some sort of ongoing effect a character is experiencing, whether physical or mental. Condition Traits can vary widely in what they represent and will almost always have their effects described in the Trait. These can range from a character having cybernetic arms, granting them significantly improved power stats to a character being a conduit for the spirits and thus able to see ghosts. Injuries will often be represented as temporary Condition Traits and will describe some sort of negative attribute or incapacity forced onto the character.
                                    <h5 class="mt-4">Other</h4>
                                    <p>Other is a catchall category and represents special Traits that go beyond the norm. Most Other Traits are, in reality, multiple Traits listed at the same time for the sake of convenience. As an example, a character being possessed by a daemon may have that possession listed as an Other Trait, and that Traits description may describe significant alterations to how that character would otherwise function.</p>

                                            <p class="copy">
                                                Skill checks are a process by which an action a character undertakes or a situation they are presented with requires measuring the character's attributes or abilities in some way. Skill checks take a variety of forms, from measuring a character's raw strength or mental fortitude to testing a character's ability to ride a horse or solve a complex equation. Skill checks, as a game mechanic, are expressed through a die roll on a d20, and the result of that roll is compared against a target value. Meeting or exceeding the required value is a success; falling below is a failure. The die roll will typically be modified by a character's stat values, equipment they may be utilizing, or any number of other factors.
                                                <br><br>
                                                Skill checks will typically have one or more associated outer ring stat values. Add the associated stat total to the roll for the check. Some effects will require established stats outlined by the rules associated with whatever is requiring the check, but in most situations the DM will determine what stats are being measured. When a skill check asks for an inner ring stat, the character can decide which of the outer ring stats in that category they wish to use.
                                                <br><br>
                                                Skill checks are a way for a DM to measure a character against some form of adversity or to grade their performance. A skill check may have a target value that is known to the player or one that is known only to the DM. Some skill checks may not have a target value at all and are instead looking to see how "good" the roll is and rationalizing how that character's effort meets their need (such as establishing the quality of a character's work of art). How skills are truly utilized is typically a style of DMing more than a hard and fast set of rules.
                                                <br><br>
                                                Ex. A character may have to take a lifting (Power) skill check in order to lift a very heavy object.
                                                <br>
                                                Ex. A character may have to take a fear (demeanor) skill check to avoid cowering at the sight of a dragon.
                                                <br><br>
                                            </p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Skill check results are rolled on a d20. The result of this roll is then modified by all roll modifiers and compared against a target value. If the skill check meets or exceeds the value, it "succeeds." If the roll falls below the value, it "fails."</li>
                                                <li>Most skill checks will reference an outer ring stat. When a skill check references a stat, you add the character's stat value to the total.</li>
                                                <li>If a skill check references an inner ring stat, the character can choose one relevant outer ring stat to add to the die roll.</li>
                                                <li>Some complex skill checks will reference more than one outer ring skill. For these checks the player needs to roll for each skill separately. The result is a combination of those successes and failures, and that result is up to the DM. Ex. A spy driving a car in a foreign land could have a skill check against both their grace and memory. The first for the act of driving itself, the second to demonstrate that they remember the road laws of the country they are infiltrating.</li>
                                                <li>Skill success is a gradient; succeeding by a small amount may technically succeed but may incur some unforeseen event. Meanwhile, failing or succeeding hugely may result in significant benefits or consequences. The extent to which a character succeeds or fails is up to the DM.
                                                    <ul>
                                                        <li>Ex. You were not detected while sneaking but stepped on a twig. The guards are now more alert.</li>
                                                        <li>Ex. You failed the jump but can still catch the ledge with your arms to avoid falling down the pit.</li>
                                                        <li>EX. You brewed a potion perfectly, slightly amplifying its abilities.</li>
                                                        <li>Ex. You fumbled the lock and broke the mechanism; you can't try again.</li>
                                                    </ul>
                                                </li>
                                                <li>Some skill checks can be repeatedly attempted until the character succeeds or stops trying. It is up to the DM to decide what checks can be repeated and how long they take.</li>
                                                <li>If a character's modifiers to the roll would mean that roll automatically meets or exceeds the check's target value, the player can forgo rolling at all if they wish, though the DM may still ask for them to roll in order to know how far they exceed the requirement.</li>
                                            </ul>

                                                <li>ex. A character with a background as a fisherman may be able to request advantage in a situation where they need to maintain balance while the airship they are on is suffering severe turbulence due to the character's past with the rocky seas.

                                                Skill check requirements range from -10 to 80, with an explanation of what those values represent below. Higher checks required higher relevant rolls and modifiers to succeed. A check that notes a stat can have that stat added to its total. A Complex check that notes multiple stats must roll separately for each stat. In general, as actions grow more complex or multi-staged, the relevant skill checks will require more stats to be rolled against at once.

                                                The difference between a requirement of 40 and 60 is often the difference between the daily acts of a master in a profession and something that requires days or weeks of prep time, perfectly attuned equipment, and external forces acting to make the check succeed. Accomplishable by characters with advanced feats and high-end equipment. Often both. While stats may have an impact on the roll, skill checks at this level rely more on training and preparation than on talent. Most extreme skills are in this range.
