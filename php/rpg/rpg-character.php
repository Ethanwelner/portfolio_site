			<ul>
				<li>Character Level is tracked separately from outer ring stats.</li>
				<li>Inner ring stats are listed as a single number docked to their outer ring lines.</li>
				<li>The outer ring lines start unfilled, and are filled in as the player adds points to them, looking at the circle or squares to know what kind of feat they gain.</li>
				<li>Characters select a race, origin, profession, and past.</li>
				<li>The characters race determines their starting stats, max stats, grants any unique ability the race may possess, and grants access to various feat categories.</li>
				<li>The character's origin grants access to a starting set of origin feats, typically a mix of regular and knowledge feats. It also grants access to selectable feats related to the origin as well as other RP specific things (wealth, identification, etc).</li>
				<li>The character's profession grants access to a starting set of profession feats, typically a mix of regular and knowledge feats. It also grants access to selectable feats related to the profession as well as other RP specific things (equipment, licenses, etc).</li>
				<li>Since characters start with outer ring stats related to their race they will typically start with a set of player-selectable feats. A human starts with 1 point in each outer ring stat, so they start with 9 universal feats in addition to the feats automatically granted to them by their race, origin, profession and past. Since they also only have a single point in each stat (plus three points for level 1) their selection will be relatively limited to less powerful and more common feats.
				</li>
				<li>It may be preferable to start a campaign with characters at level 2 or 3, so that they can pick out the low level but still specialized feats their character would possess and to help them differentiate from each other.</li>
				<li>This character has selected to use two of its universal feats gained at level 1 to increase its knowledge in contraband and security, it can do this due to being a freshly created character. Future stats gains can not be used to gain knowledge feats, though this is at the DMs discretion.
