					<h5><strong>Resisting Damage Types</strong></h5>
					<div class="line"></div>
				</div>
				<p class="copy">Resistances are used to reduce incoming damage by a specified amount. Resistances begin at zero. Incoming damage will always have a type, and some forms of attacks will do multiple types of damage at once. A fiery explosion will do both blunt damage through the explosion itself, as well as heat damage through the heat of the fireball. Resistances are predominantly conveyed through equipment, but some Traits may provide additional resistances. A character's resistances are cumulative; if a character has both leather armor and scaly skin, their resistance to slashing will be higher than if they had either alone.<br><br>
				Some resistances will have coverage areas specified, such as a helmet providing significant protection, but only on the head. How and where a character is hit is covered in the section on combat. Resistances can, in rare cases, be a negative value. In these cases they add to the damage inflicted a value equal to that negative number.</p>

				<h3 class="mb-3">Damage Types</h3>
				
				<div class="line-container">
					<h5><strong>Physical</strong></h5>
					<div class="line"></div>
				</div>
				
				<h6 class=""><strong>Blunt</strong></h6>
				<p class="copy mb-3">Blunt attacks are those that impact evenly across a wide area, such as a strike from a club or the wide blast front of an explosion. Any sudden change in pressure, such as being thrown out an airlock, would also be tracked as blunt damage. Blunt attacks can often cause the Concussed Temporary Condition Trait.</p>
				
				<h6 class=""><strong>Slashing</strong></h6>
				<p class="copy mb-3">Slashing attacks are those that cut across a wide area, such as a swing from a sword or a slash from animal claws. Slashing attacks can often cause the Bleeding Temporary Condition Trait.</p>
				
				<h6 class=""><strong>Piercing</strong></h6>
				<p class="copy mb-3">Piercing attacks are those that impact sharply in a small area and pierce deep, such as a thrust from a spear or the impact of a bullet. Piercing attacks can often cause the Bleeding Temporary Condition Trait.</p>
				
				<div class="line-container">
					<h5><strong>Elemental</strong></h5>
					<div class="line"></div>
				</div>
				
				<h6 class=""><strong>Heat</strong></h6>
				<p class="copy mb-3">Heat represents the damage caused by very high thermal energy/temps being applied to an area, be it from fire, a laser, or any other source. Fire is a common form of elemental damage that can be encountered easily both in and out of combat. Heat damage can often cause the Burning Temporary Condition Trait.</p>
				
				<h6 class=""><strong>Cold</strong></h6>
				<p class="copy mb-3">Cold represents the damage caused by thermal energy being removed from an object or character, be it from contact with ice, exposure to the elements, or any other source. Cold damage will most commonly be a result of exposure to extremely cold climates, and the ways this damage manifests itself will often be outside of combat. Cold damage can sometimes cause the Frozen Temporary Condition Trait.</p>
				
				<h6 class=""><strong>Electrical</strong></h6>
				<p class="copy mb-3">Electrical represents the application of electricity to a system that isn't built to handle it, be it from lightning, a downed power line, or an electric eel. The threat of electric shock is far more common in a modern electrically powered society, but its a classic element of magic. Electrical attacks can often cause the Concussed Temporary Condition Trait.</p>
				
				<h6 class=""><strong>EMP</strong></h6>
				<p class="copy mb-3">EMP or Electromagnetic Pulse is a catchall term for electromagnetic damage that is specifically harmful to machines or computer systems that rely on electricity or magnetic attributes to function. EMP damage's most common interaction will be to disable or destroy mechanical or electronic systems, either intentionally or accidentally. EMPs can be caused by natural or manmade phenomena, from solar flares to nuclear explosions. EMP damage can only harm characters or objects with the Mechanical Trait.</p>
				
				<div class="line-container">
					<h5><strong>Supernatural</strong></h5>
					<div class="line"></div>
				</div>
				
				<h6 class=""><strong>Metaphysical</strong></h6>
				<p class="copy mb-3">Metaphysical damage represents the damage inflicted by any higher plane source and does not interact with normal matter in a scientifically understood manner. Metaphysical attacks or effects will contain a description for if and when they do extra damage or possess other effects. Metaphysical effects will often be associated with other traits or keywords that further define their interactions in the game.</p>
				<p class="copy mb-3">Ex. A Paladins sword that bypasses the armor of the Demonic or an enchantment that only harms the Undead.</p>
				
				<h6 class=""><strong>Death</strong></h6>
				<p class="copy mb-3">Death damage represents a loss of vitality or the sudden rotting of flesh that would be otherwise considered scientifically impossible. Attacks or effects with the death attribute will often describe debilitating secondary effects they inflict beyond the HP damage they cause; successful (Physical) checks can often resist these effects. Death damage or attacks can not typically harm those with the Mechanical trait.</p>
				
				<h6 class=""><strong>Psychic</strong></h6>
				<p class="copy mb-3">Psychic damage represents harm inflicted directly upon one's brain, ego, consciousness, or other mental capacity. Psychic attacks or damage will typically bypass all defenses and will inflict various Condition Traits with concussed being the most common. Successful (mental) or (social) checks can often resist the effects of Psychic attacks/damage.</p>
				
				<div class="line-container">
					<h5><strong>Other Common Elemental Effects</strong></h5>
					<div class="line"></div>
				</div>
				
				<h6 class=""><strong>Radiation</strong></h6>
				<p class="copy mb-3">Radiation is an element in nature that can cause the Irradiated(1) Condition Trait. Levels of radiation exposure can cause different and increasingly severe effects, and certain effects or resistances in the game will make a user resistant or immune to radiation. Much like in real life, radiation can spread, and a character or object with a high level of the Irradiated trait can, in turn, inflict that trait on others.</p>
				
				<h6 class=""><strong>Acidic/Corrosive</strong></h6>
				<p class="copy mb-3">Acidic or Corrosive effects will often cause damage to items or equipment in addition to any character wielding them. This will most commonly be represented by the Corroded(1) ranked trait to be inflicted on an object that has been affected.</p>

			<h3 class="mb-3">Items</h3>
				
				<div class="line-container">
					<h5><strong>What is an Item?</strong></h5>
					<div class="line"></div>
				</div>
				<p class="copy">An item can be any physical object that a character can be in possession of. This can range from weapons to armor to currency to pets. Some items have considerable complexities of their own, such as a ship or a warhorse. Other items are as simple as a gold coin. All fall under the category of "items." Within the category of "items," there are several subcategories explained below. Items possess their own descriptions, functions, weight, and size and may confer abilities or be used by a character in a unique way. Items will typically be described somewhere external to a character's character sheet, but in cases where the item is truly unique (such as a fancy rock the character found), then the DM can describe the physical characteristics of the item in question. Items are recorded in the "items" section of the character sheet. There is no limit to the number of items a character can possess, though there are reasonable limits on what they can carry. A character may possess a house on their character sheet, but they aren't taking it around with them.</p>
				
				<p class="copy">The various types of equipment and unique attributes (if any) are described below.</p>
