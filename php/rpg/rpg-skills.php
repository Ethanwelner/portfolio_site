				<h3 class="mb-4">What is a Skill Check?</h3>
				<p class="copy">
					Skill checks are a process by which an action a character undertakes or a situation they are presented with requires measuring the character's attributes or abilities in some way. Skill checks take a variety of forms, from measuring a character's raw strength or mental fortitude to testing a character's ability to ride a horse or solve a complex equation. Skill checks, as a game mechanic, are expressed through a die roll on a d20, and the result of that roll is compared against a target value. Meeting or exceeding the required value is a success; falling below is a failure. The die roll will typically be modified by a character's stat values, equipment they may be utilizing, or any number of other factors.
					<br><br>
					Skill checks will typically have one or more associated outer ring stat values. Add the associated stat total to the roll for the check. Some effects will require established stats outlined by the rules associated with whatever is requiring the check, but in most situations the DM will determine what stats are being measured. When a skill check asks for an inner ring stat, the character can decide which of the outer ring stats in that category they wish to use.
					<br><br>
					Skill checks are a way for a DM to measure a character against some form of adversity or to grade their performance. A skill check may have a target value that is known to the player or one that is known only to the DM. Some skill checks may not have a target value at all and are instead looking to see how "good" the roll is and rationalizing how that character's effort meets their need (such as establishing the quality of a character's work of art). How skills are truly utilized is typically a style of DMing more than a hard and fast set of rules.
					<br><br>
					Ex. A character may have to take a lifting (Power) skill check in order to lift a very heavy object.
					<br>
					Ex. A character may have to take a fear (demeanor) skill check to avoid cowering at the sight of a dragon.
					<br><br>
				</p>
				<ul class="copy">
					<li>Skill check results are rolled on a d20. The result of this roll is then modified by all roll modifiers and compared against a target value. If the skill check meets or exceeds the value, it "succeeds." If the roll falls below the value, it "fails."</li>
					<li>Most skill checks will reference an outer ring stat. When a skill check references a stat, you add the character's stat value to the total.</li>
					<li>If a skill check references an inner ring stat, the character can choose one relevant outer ring stat to add to the die roll.</li>
					<li>Some complex skill checks will reference more than one outer ring skill. For these checks the player needs to roll for each skill separately. The result is a combination of those successes and failures, and that result is up to the DM. Ex. A spy driving a car in a foreign land could have a skill check against both their grace and memory. The first for the act of driving itself, the second to demonstrate that they remember the road laws of the country they are infiltrating.</li>
					<li>Skill success is a gradient; succeeding by a small amount may technically succeed but may incur some unforeseen event. Meanwhile, failing or succeeding hugely may result in significant benefits or consequences. The extent to which a character succeeds or fails is up to the DM.
						<ul>
							<li>Ex. You were not detected while sneaking but stepped on a twig. The guards are now more alert.</li>
							<li>Ex. You failed the jump but can still catch the ledge with your arms to avoid falling down the pit.</li>
							<li>EX. You brewed a potion perfectly, slightly amplifying its abilities.</li>
							<li>Ex. You fumbled the lock and broke the mechanism; you can't try again.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Some skill checks can be repeatedly attempted until the character succeeds or stops trying. It is up to the DM to decide what checks can be repeated and how long they take.</li>
					<li>If a character's modifiers to the roll would mean that roll automatically meets or exceeds the check's target value, the player can forgo rolling at all if they wish, though the DM may still ask for them to roll in order to know how far they exceed the requirement.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3 class="mb-3">Requesting Advantage</h3>
				<ul class="copy">
					<li>A character can request advantage in a situation where they believe they are uniquely advantaged in the effort of performing some sort of task or skill or in a role-playing scenario.</li>
					<li>Some feats will specify a situation where a character can request advantage that is tied to a specific skill set or physical attribute</li>
					<li>Requesting advantage is an expression of both the stats written on a character sheet and the character's backstory and role-playing attributes.</li>
					<li>Some races, backgrounds, or professions will infer the right to request advantage in a broad set of circumstances, such as a character with a small stature being able to request advantage when hiding or a professional soldier's ability to request advantage when learning to wield a new weapon.</li>
					<li>The dm can allow or deny requested advantage and will determine the appropriate expression of the advantage</li>
					<li>ex. A character with a background as a fisherman may be able to request advantage in a situation where they need to maintain balance while the airship they are on is suffering severe turbulence due to the character's past with the rocky seas. The DM could choose to give them a +5 to their grace roll to stay standing.</li>
					<li>ex. A character is a pilot and is piloting the ship they built by hand and know by heart. The DM could choose to give them a bonus to a skill check or even waive the need for the skill check if the act could be considered routine.</li>
				</ul>

				<div class="bumper"></div>

				<h3 class="mb-3">Requesting Competence</h3>
				<ul class="copy">
					<li>A character can Request competence in any situation where they believe other related factors give them enough of a baseline level of capability that they shouldn't be penalized as harshly or at all for lacking a specific skill.</li>
					<li>A Character with expertise in wielding a sword can request competence when wielding a dagger, even if they don't have a feat giving them that skill.</li>
					<li>Requested competence can result in a wide range of results, from the user being wholly proficient in the task at hand to even being granted a relevant feat that gives them that skill permanently.</li>
					<li>A bard skilled with a guitar and a bass can likely request competence with a lute, but the DM may consider the violin to be a step too far.</li>
					<li>Many feats that grant expertise in a skill also grant inferred competence in related skills.</li>

				<h3 class="mb-4">Skill Check Difficulty Ranges</h3>
				<p class="copy">
					Skill check requirements range from -10 to 80, with an explanation of what those values represent below. Higher checks required higher relevant rolls and modifiers to succeed. A check that notes a stat can have that stat added to its total. A Complex check that notes multiple stats must roll separately for each stat. In general, as actions grow more complex or multi-staged, the relevant skill checks will require more stats to be rolled against at once.
					<br><br>
					Checks at 0 or below are automatically accomplishable even with no skill and often even with difficulty modifiers to the check. These would only be checked if there was a realistic chance of failure.

				</div>

				<p>
					Checks between 1 and 20 are accomplishable by any character as long as there are no difficulty modifiers. There is a 20x gap between a check of a 1 and 20 though, and while having relevant stats, equipment, or feats may make these checks easy or even automatic, a character not fit for the task may find them almost impossible.

					The difference between a requirement of 20 and 40 is often the difference between requiring novice or expert training, or requiring simple or advanced equipment. Accomplishable by characters with high stats, relevant feats, or equipment. Many professions have their day to day actions in this range. Skill checks in this range are often still heavily impacted by raw stat values.

						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p>
					The difference between a requirement of 40 and 60 is often the difference between the daily acts of a master in a profession and something that requires days or weeks of prep time, perfectly attuned equipment, and external forces acting to make the check succeed. Accomplishable by characters with advanced feats and high-end equipment. Often both. While stats may have an impact on the roll, skill checks at this level rely more on training and preparation than on talent. Most extreme skills are in this range.

						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p>
					Checks between 61 and 80 are absurdly difficult or are considered impossible by normal means. If a complex task looks like it's in this range, it may be better to break it down into multiple smaller tasks.

							A check of this nature is almost asking to measure how extreme the Character's failure is. A check of this difficulty may actually be accomplishable if the nature of the action allows the Character to slowly accrue larger and larger Advantage through many repeated and well-supported attempts.
